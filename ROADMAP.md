#  ROADMAP  2026 Milestones (Q1  Q4)

This roadmap is milestone-driven. Each quarter focuses on learning goals, project work, and community contributions.

## Q1  Foundations & Fast Wins

- Learning: Advanced DSA (algorithms, data structures), Python best practices, unit testing
- Courses: Advanced ML engineering, Hugging Face quickstart
- Projects: Start GenAI Chatbot (prototype), small data viz dashboard
- Community: Publish a short blog about replicable model evaluation

Milestones:
- January: Complete 1 advanced DSA course and practice problems
- February: Build chatbot prototype (local), create basic README & demo
- March: Publish first blog and give a lightning talk

## Q2  LLMOps & RAG / Semantic Search

- Learning: LangChain, Vector DBs (FAISS, Milvus), RAG pipelines
- Projects: Semantic search pipeline, integrate RAG with GenAI chatbot
- Community: Contribute PRs to a small OSS project; publish tutorial

Milestones:
- April: Build semantic indexing pipeline (embeddings, storage)
- May: Integrate retrieval into chatbot; add tests and evaluation
- June: Workshop or webinar on building semantic search for QA

## Q3  Productionization & Cloud

- Learning: FastAPI, containerization (Docker), CI/CD, infra on AWS/GCP
- Projects: Deploy ML models to cloud endpoints; dashboards for monitoring
- Community: Open-source a project scaffold (templates)

Milestones:
- July: Containerize services and add CI pipeline
- August: Deploy a model on cloud (AWS/GCP) with autoscaling basics
- September: Publish case study and best-practices guide

## Q4  Generative Models & Research Outreach

- Learning: Diffusion models, advanced transformers, fine-tuning strategies
- Projects: Build an advanced GenAI demo (multimodal or chained agents)
- Community: Present at a meetup / contribute to research repos

Milestones:
- October: Fine-tune or adapt a transformer for a niche task
- November: Build multimodal demo and documentation
- December: Summarize 2026 learnings; publish roadmap and next-year plan

---

Each milestone will include measurable acceptance criteria (tests, README, demo notebook, cost estimate for deployment).
