# CONTRIBUTING

Thanks for your interest in contributing! A few guidelines to keep this repo friendly and productive.

1. Fork the repo and create a branch for your change.
2. Keep changes small and focused; add tests or example notebooks where possible.
3. Follow the repository style: clear README updates, reproducible examples, and no large files committed to Git.
4. Open an issue first for significant changes or new project proposals.
5. Use respectful, constructive language in PR descriptions and issue discussions.

If you'd like to co-author a project or tutorial, open an issue with your proposal and timeline.
