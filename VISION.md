#  VISION  Long-term Professional Vision

As an AI/ML engineer and GenAI practitioner, my long-term vision is to:

- Build reliable, safe, and accessible generative systems that amplify human creativity and productivity.
- Advocate for reproducible, well-documented experiments and share practical tools that help others ship.
- Contribute to community knowledge via open-source, writing, and teaching.

I aim to transition from prototyping to production-ready systems, mentor others, and help organizations responsibly adopt GenAI.
