# GenAI Chatbot

Goal: Build a conversational agent (local prototype) that supports retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

Tech stack: Python, LangChain, Hugging Face / OpenAI, FAISS, FastAPI (for serving)

What to include:
- Demo notebook with example prompts
- RAG pipeline: embeddings  vector store  retriever  generator
- Evaluation script and test cases

Getting started:

1. Activate environment from `environment.yml`
2. Install requirements
3. Open `app.py` for a minimal server and `notebook.ipynb` for experiments
