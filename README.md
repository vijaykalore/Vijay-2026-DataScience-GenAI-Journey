#  Hi  I'm Vijay. Welcome to my 2026 Data Science & GenAI journey.

I'm a Computer Engineering graduate working as a Data Scientist and Analyst, and in 2026 I'm focused on becoming a stronger AI engineer and GenAI practitioner. I created this repository to track what I learn, the projects I ship, and the ways I give back to the community.

##  Why this repo

I prefer practical, reproducible work that others can read, run, and build on. Here you'll find my learning plan, quarter-by-quarter roadmap, project scaffolds, and curated resources. My goal is to turn prototypes into production patterns and explain the steps clearly — for recruiters, collaborators, and learners.

## What I'll focus on in 2026

- Building production-minded GenAI demos (RAG-enabled chatbots, semantic search)
- Improving engineering practices (testing, CI/CD, containerization)
- Sharing what I learn via notebooks, blog posts, and short talks
- Contributing code and documentation to open-source projects I rely on

##  Repo at a glance

- `README.md`  This page: mission, quick start, and priorities
- `ROADMAP.md`  Quarter-by-quarter milestones and acceptance criteria
- `LEARNING.md`  What I'm studying and why
- `PROJECTS/`  Active project folders with clear READMEs and starter code
- `RESOURCES.md`  Books, papers, courses, and tutorials I use
- `CONTRIBUTIONS.md`  How I plan to contribute to OSS and the community
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`  Simple rules for collaborators
- `VISION.md`  My long-term professional vision
- `requirements.txt`, `environment.yml`  reproducible environment definitions
- `LICENSE`  MIT (I encourage reuse and collaboration)

## Quick start (run locally)

1. Clone the repo:

   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Vijay-2026-DataScience-GenAI-Journey.git

2. Create the conda environment and install dependencies:

```powershell
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate vijay-2026-genai
```

Or, with pip:

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Pick a project folder in `PROJECTS/` and open its README to get started.

## What to expect from each project

- A short README describing goals and acceptance criteria
- A notebook or minimal demo that is easy to run locally
- Notes on deployment, evaluation, and how you can contribute

## Want to collaborate or give feedback?

- Add your suggestion as an issue or open a discussion in this repo.
- If you'd like to co-author a tutorial or demo, open an issue with the idea and timeline.
